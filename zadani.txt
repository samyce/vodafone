USER STORY
--------------
I, as business analyst want simple server, where I will input/send customer data (in .csv file) and get
    - recommended action for them (see Resolver)
    - basic statistics (see Stats)

So I can decide on marketing action.

Technical assignment
----------------------------
Create Backend server application in PHP. 
It will accept POST request with attached (.csv) file.
It will return a json response with data (bellow).
The API will be under user/password protection - basic auth.
Do not forget to follow VF standards (design patterns, !!UNIT TESTING!!, naming)

Technical recommendations:
------------------------
- Minimum of 3 classes
	- One will receive request and orchestrate the logic
	- Second will parse the input
	- Third will resolve the customer action
	- You can have as many classes as you want
	
Parser
 - Input will be .csv data
    - NAME, CREDIT, LAST_TOP_UP_DATE (dd.mm.yyyy)
	
Resolver
 - 3 Rules
    - CREDIT < 200 ----> action: SMS
    - LAST TOP UP DATE > 5 months -----> action: SMS
    - CREDIT <= 300 && LAST TOP UP DATE < 2 months ----> action: SMS
    - other (do not meet the criteria above) -----> action: NONE

Stats
- Action x count
	
Other Notes
---------------
- Follow our standards.pdf guide
- You can use attached .csv file as input
- You are NOT allowed to use any framework.
- Do not use any libraries or frameworks (You can use only composer for PHP Unit and PHP Stan, Code sniffer) 
- You are recommended to use Composer to load PHP Unit and static analytic tools
- Use PHP 7.2 
- Do not work for more than 6 hours (we want to see what you can do in that time)
- Application does not need to be perfect, but it should be working
